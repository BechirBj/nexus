You are an expert full-stack engineer, UX designer, and product thinker.
Your task is to vibe-code a web application MVP using Next.js (App Router) and Tailwind CSS, focused on subject-based knowledge organization.
Use static / mock data only (no backend, no auth, no database).
The goal is to design a clean, intuitive, future-proof UI and architecture that can later scale to private → public usage.

PRODUCT CONCEPT

Build a Subject-based Knowledge Workspace.

Users can create multiple Subjects (topics, categories, projects).
Each Subject contains:

PDF documents

Written reports (compte rendus)

The platform is private/local by default, but the UX and structure must clearly anticipate public sharing and collaboration later.

This is not just a file manager.
It is a thinking and learning workspace.

TECH STACK CONSTRAINTS

Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Data: Static mock data only (stored in local files)

No authentication

No backend

No file uploads (simulate PDFs with metadata)

Design the codebase as if it will later connect to a real backend.

CORE DATA MODELS (STATIC)

Design static data structures for:

Subject

id

title

description

coverColor or coverImage

createdAt

updatedAt

visibility (private | shared | public)

tags (array of strings)

Document (PDF)

id

subjectId

title

description

fileName (mock)

uploadedAt

tags

linkedReportIds

Report (Compte rendu)

id

subjectId

title

content (mock rich text or markdown)

status (draft | final | archived)

createdAt

updatedAt

linkedDocumentIds

tags

CORE SCREENS TO IMPLEMENT
1. Dashboard (Subjects Overview)

Purpose: give a mental map of all subjects

Include:

Grid or list of Subject cards

Subject card shows:

Title

Short description

Stats (# documents, # reports)

Last updated date

“Create new subject” CTA (mock)

Filter by tag

Search subjects by name

UX tone: calm, focused, knowledge-oriented.

2. Subject Page (Main Workspace)

This is the heart of the app.

Structure:

Subject header:

Title

Description

Visibility badge (private/shared/public – visual only)

Tags

Tabs or segmented navigation:

Overview

Documents

Reports

Timeline

Tags

3. Subject → Overview Tab

Purpose: contextual understanding.

Include:

Editable-looking summary section (static)

“What is this subject about?” copy

Quick stats

Recently added documents & reports

Linked subjects section (mocked)

4. Subject → Documents Tab

Purpose: manage PDFs as knowledge inputs.

Include:

List of documents

Each document card shows:

Title

Description

Tags

Upload date

Linked reports count

Filters:

By tag

By “linked to report / not linked”

“Add document” button (mock modal)

5. Subject → Reports Tab

Purpose: written thinking & synthesis.

Include:

List of reports

Each report card shows:

Title

Status badge (draft/final/archived)

Tags

Linked documents

Last updated date

“Create report” CTA

Clicking opens a Report Detail Page

6. Report Detail Page

Purpose: focused reading & writing.

Include:

Report title

Status selector (visual only)

Content area (markdown or rich-text styled)

Linked documents sidebar

Tags

Metadata (created / updated dates)

Design for future commenting and collaboration (empty comment section placeholder).

7. Subject → Timeline Tab

Purpose: sense of progression.

Show a chronological feed of:

Document uploads

Report creations

Report updates

Each item links to its detail page.

DESIGN & UX PRINCIPLES

Minimalist, calm, “thinking space” aesthetic

Soft borders, subtle shadows

Clear visual hierarchy

Color used meaningfully (subjects have identity)

Empty states that explain purpose

Icons used sparingly

FUTURE-READY CONSIDERATIONS (DESIGN ONLY)

Even though not implemented, the UI should hint at:

Collaboration (avatars placeholders)

Comments

Sharing

Public subject pages

Forking or duplicating subjects

CODE STRUCTURE EXPECTATIONS

Clear folder organization

Reusable components:

SubjectCard

DocumentCard

ReportCard

Tag

Tabs

Mock data stored in a dedicated file

Clean separation between UI and data

Descriptive comments explaining future extensions

OUTPUT EXPECTATION

Generate using TYPESCRIPT:

Next.ts app structure

Pages and components

Tailwind styling

Static mock data

Thoughtful UI copy

Sensible defaults

Focus on clarity, product thinking, and UX, not just code.

The result should feel like:

“This could become a real product.”

Do not over-engineer.
Do not add backend logic.
Do not add authentication.

Just vibe-code a strong, elegant MVP foundation.
